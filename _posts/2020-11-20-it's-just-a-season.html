<p>This feeling is just a season <br> 
of growing and falling <br>
to think and to reason <br>
To seed and bloom again.</p>  

<p>We are not glass <br>
a museum piece <br>
or an art.  <br>
To be enshrined in its beauty <br>
if torn, then forever lost <br>
these pieces never to be whole again. </p>  

<p>We are that flower <br>
that softly ever blooms <br>
a beauty, if torn, can grow <br>
we are nature <br>
that withers and blooms <br>
falling only to sprout again.</p>  

<p>I know this wilting is just a season <br>
like moon in the waning <br>
and this dark is just a turning <br>
I can wait until it's spring again. </p>
