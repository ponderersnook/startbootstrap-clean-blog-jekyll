<p> I am an ICT Engineer from Gujarat, India. 
  ICT is Information and Communication Technology, which basically mean that I studies ana amalgamation of Computer Science, Electronics and Communication subjects. 
  My interests lie towards more hardware and electronic side of things. Though physics is my one true love. </p>

<p> I like to think of myself as a perpetual student and like to keep pushing my horizons. 
  Therefore, you will often find me dabbling in a new hobby or finding a new shiny thing to obsess over. 
  But most often than not you will find my nose buried in a book.</p>
